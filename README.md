## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned how to validate form with excluding more error cases. The most challenging part was formatting card number. It has to me in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX format but I wasn't able to manage it, so I took the code from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/71093239)

But the main part, which is validating the form inputs, was quite fun to achieve and I always learn something new from every form related projects.
